= Experience / Projects

- *Escobedo Medina Auditores Asociados*  --  2019 - Current  --  _(Not yet published)_ +
I'm co-leading a team building a web-based ERP using *React*, *NodeJs/Express*, *Mysql* and *Docker*.

- http://www.bolivarparalelo.com/beta[Bolivar Paralelo (beta)]  --  2018 - Current  --  https://github.com/madacol/bolivarparalelo[source] +
A hobbie project that analyzes http://www.localbitcoins.com to get currency rates in bitcoins, calculate cross rates between currencies and render history graphs. +
Built with *Svelte*, *Ruby/Sinatra* and *PostgreSql*

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHU5xQRTyus[ArduinoOven] - an arduino-controlled conveyor oven  --  2018 - Current  --  https://github.com/madacol/ArduinoOven[source] +
Designed, built and developed the electronic system using an *Arduino Mega* with a Touchscreen interface. +
I implemented software-based-PIDs to control temperatures and conveyor's speed. +
A *Raspberry Pi Zero* is connected to the Arduino, which logs data from Serial port, and allows me to connect remotely through SSH to flash the Arduino. +
Built with *C++/Arduino*, *1 Arduino Mega*, *1 TouchScreen*, *4 temperature sensors*, *2 Servomotors*, *2 Encoders*, *1 DC Motor* and *2 Relays* +

- https://github.com/madacol/webOven[webOven]  --  2019 - Current +
Minimal web for the *ArduinoOven* that runs in the Raspberry Pi Zero. It shows graphical history of the sensors and actuators. +
Built with *Python/Flask* and *matplotlib* for graphing.

- http://www.mifacturaperu.com/[Mi Factura Per√∫]  --  2019 +
Built the website with *PHP/Laravel*. +
Mantained a desktop app that help businesses make electronic invoices. +
Built with *VB.NET/WPF*, *PHP/Slim* and *Mysql*.

- https://github.com/madacol/bitcoin-miners-monitor[Bitcoin miners monitoring system]  --  2015-2016 +
Python scripts that ran in a Raspberry Pi to monitor bitcoin miners (Antminer S5) through LAN +
Built with *Python*, *Raspberry Pi*, *Google Form/Sheets*, *exim4 (Linux mailer)*

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8dKf8xgoI[Helical Milling]  --  ~ 2013  --  https://github.com/madacol/helical-milling[source] +
Designed, built and developed the electronic system for a conventional milling machine to produce helical gears. +
I implemented an encoder attached to the X axis and read it with a Microcontroller which then controls a Stepper motor attached to the chuck that rotates the piece. +
The encoder just reads the trayectory in the X axis, and according to a previous configuration
latexmath:[\frac{AnglesToRotate}{StepsInX}]
it rotates the piece to follow the desired helical angle. +
Built with a *PIC16F877* in *C*

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joTXaflXwJw[CNC router]  --  ~ 2009 - 2012 +
Built and adapted the electronic system
